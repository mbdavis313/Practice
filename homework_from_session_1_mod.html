       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework">Homework in a new tab.</a>
       <!-- Homework reference from Wikipedia opens in same tab but strong-->
       <p> 2. One link tagged with strong importance</p>
       <strong> This is the same Link with STRONG importance </strong>
       <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework">Homework with Strong Importance.</a></strong>
       <!-- Placeholder link that goes nowhere-->
       <p> 3. One link that is only a placeholder (it goes nowhere when clicked)</p>
